# Generative-Modelling-Projects

This repo contains notebooks for a selection of Generative Modelling projects I've undertook. Below are descriptions of each of each of the projects and links to the corresponding repositories;

Time-GEBM https://github.com/ConnorWatts/Time-GEBM  

Thesis for MSc Computational Statistics and Machine Learning program at UCL. Here I implement two generalized energy based models for time-series generation.

C-GEBM https://github.com/ConnorWatts/C-GEBM 

Modified the GEBM framework for image generation to allow for class conditioning. 

MTL-GAN https://github.com/ConnorWatts/Multi-Task-GAN

Developed a MTL framework for image GANs. Demonstrated that by jointly learning image classification tasks the generator produces more realistic and diverse images. For a demonstation please see corresponding notebook.
